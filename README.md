When you run this project, you can see the employee list page.
You can click any employee, and then you can move to timesheet page. I used Router for this.

Here you can see the Username, email, Position from the users. and also you can see the timesheet info such as Assessment, start and end time, status.
you can filter by month on the top of select month list.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
